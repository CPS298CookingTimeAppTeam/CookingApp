Hello everyone,

My name is Kyle and I’m taking this class as a requirement for my associates in Computer Science. I would love to be able to create my own programs/apps/projects by myself one day so that’s a future goal of mine.

This is now my 5th semester at WCC, and I’m looking at transferring to UofM Dearborn.

My programing experience is limited, I have worked on problems and smaller projects, but still lack a lot of confidence and knowledge.

I’ve taken many online courses now, and honestly the best thing to do is try and work ahead if possible, it really takes the stress off and gives yourself more time to ask for help.

Outside of class, I really enjoying sports/games/art and travel. I live in Tokyo for 4 years and would strongly recommend people to experience it for themselves!

I hope you all have a great semester.
