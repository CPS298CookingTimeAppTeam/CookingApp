My name is Ben Wittkopp. I am takig this class to deepe my knowlege on Java as well as to get a credit.
 I have so far taken 4 semesters at the University of Toledo and this will be my 3rd semester at WCC.
 I should be able to transfer to finish my Computer Science degree after my next semester here.
 Most of my experience in programming has been through classes so far.
 I have had most of my classes recently be online and the best advice I have is to finish class work as early as possible.
 My hobbies are mostly just plying games but I am hoping to try making mods at some point.
