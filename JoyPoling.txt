I am taking this class because it is on the list of required courses.
My past college education is in nursing, as I have worked as a medical assistant for 25 years. Now I am pursuing a degree in programming. I am about halfway through.
I have no experience in programming or information technology besides being the default IT person at work.  Since we have no IT department, I fix everyone's computer problems in addition to my normal nursing workload.
If I'm not counting the ones I took 25 years ago, I have only taken online courses. I don't remember what classroom courses were like, but I suppose it doesn't matter because they're probably not the same as they were then anyway. To stay organized and motivated, I like to print out the schedule and check off tasks as I do them.
Outside of class, my hobbies and interests include astronomy.
